    <string name="email_3_subject">High school reunion?</string>
    <string name="email_3_body">
        Hi friends,\n\nI was at the grocery store on Sunday night.. when I ran into Genie Williams!
        I almost didn\'t recognize her afer 20 years!\n\nAnyway, it turns out she is on the
        organizing committee for the high school reunion this fall. I don\'t know if you were
        planning on going or not, but she could definitely use our help in trying to track down lots
        of missing alums.\n\nIf you can make it, we\'re doing a little phone-tree party at her place
        next Saturday, hoping that if we can find one person, thee more will…

    <string name="email_4_subject">Brazil trip</string>
    <string name="email_4_body">
        Thought we might be able to go over some details about our upcoming vacation.\n\nI\'ve been
        doing a bit of research and have come across a few paces in Northern Brazil that I think we
        should check out. One, the north has some of the most predictable wind on the planet. I\'d
        love to get out on the ocean and kitesurf for a couple of days if we\'re going to be
        anywhere near or around Taiba. I hear it\'s beautiful there and if you\'re up for it, I\'d
        love to go. Other than that, I haven\'t spent too much time looking into places along our
        road trip route. I\'m assuming we can find places to stay and things to do as we drive and
        find places we think look interesting. But… I know you\'re more of a planner, so if you
        have ideas or places in mind, lets jot some ideas down!\n\nMaybe we can jump on the phone
        later today if you have a second.
